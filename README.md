# DiffDockHPC
DiffDockHPC is a fork of [DiffDock](https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock), which adds support to run DiffDock on HPC systems using Singularity and Slurm.  
DiffDockHPC has been developed to be part of a consensus docking protocol: [ESSENCE-Dock](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01982).  
For more details about DiffDock itself, we refer to the [DiffDock Github](https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock) and the [Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01776).
DiffDockHPC current version matches to DiffDock v1.1 ([DiffDock-L](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18396)).  
**Note:** If you update from DiffDockHPC v1.0, it is highly recommended to perform a clean install.  

DiffDockHPC is also available for the original DiffDock v1.0 implementation. This version was used in the original [ESSENCE-Dock](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01982) paper.
In case you want to work with DiffDockHPC using the DiffDock 1.0 implementation, you can clone the project, and use `git checkout DiffDockHPCv1.0`.

### Requirements:
* Singularity 
* Slurm (There is a --no_slurm mode, but using Slurm is highly recommended)

### Installation instructions:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to it
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Jnelen/DiffDockHPC
    ```
   ```
   cd DiffDockHPC
   ```
   
2. Run a test example to automatically download the Singularity image (~3 GB) and to generate the necessary cache look-up tables for SO(2) and SO(3) distributions. (This only needs to happen once and usually takes around 15 minutes).  
   The `--no_slurm` flag is optional here, but makes it easier to track the progress.   
   ```
   python inferenceVS.py -p data/1a0q/1a0q_protein_processed.pdb -l data/1a0q/ -out TEST -j 1 --no_slurm
   ```  
   Or if you have access to a GPU, you can also add the -gpu tag like this:  
   ```
   python inferenceVS.py -p data/1a0q/1a0q_protein_processed.pdb -l data/1a0q/ -out TEST -j 1 -gpu --no_slurm
   ```  
You can also download the Singularity image manually:
   ```
   wget --no-check-certificate -r "https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1TsbuhNWA74AHfIbKV5uh2lmEnD99VlCD&confirm=t" -O singularity/DiffDockHPC.sif
   ```
   
   alternatively, you can build the singularity image yourself using:
   ```
   singularity build singularity/DiffDockHPC.sif singularity/DiffDockHPC.def
   ```
### Options

The main file to use is `inferenceVS.py`. It has the following options/flags:  

- `-p`, `-r`, `--protein_path`: 
  Path to the protein/receptor `.pdb` file.

- `-l`, `--ligand`: 
  The path to the directory of (separate) `mol2`/`sdf` ligand files.

- `--protein_ligand_csv`: 
  The path to a protein_ligand_csv file. Format and header should be like the following: complex_name,protein_path,ligand_description.
  
- `-o`, `--out`, `--out_dir`: 
  Directory where the output structures will be saved to.

- `-j`, `--jobs`: 
  Number of jobs to use.

- `-qu`, `--queue`: 
  On which node to launch the slurm jobs. The default value is the default queue for the user. Might need to be specified if there is no default queue configured.

- `-m`, `--mem`: 
  How much memory to use for each job. The default value is `4GB`.

- `-gpu`, `--gpu`: 
  Use GPU resources. This will accelerate docking calculations if a compatible GPU is available.

- `-c`, `--cores`: 
  How many cores to use for each job. The default value is `1` when used with the GPU option enabled, otherwise it defaults to `4` cores.

- `-n`, `--num_outputs`: 
  How many structures to output per compound. The default value is `1`.

- `--remove_hs`: 
  Remove the hydrogens in the final output structures.
  
- `--no_slurm`: 
  Don't use slurm to handle the resources. This will run all samples on 1 GPU. Other Slurm arguments such as the amount memory, time limit, ... will also be ignored. The amount of CPU cores will still be set.

- `--config`: 
  Path to the config file you want to use. Defaults to `default_inference_args.yaml`

- `-h`, `--help`: 
  Show the help message and exit.
